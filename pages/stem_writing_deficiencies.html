        There’s a stereotype floating around the collegiate world that STEM students aren’t greatat writing, or more accurately they don’t like writing. You are faced with a pretty 
        rigorous four-year course load, filled with advanced classes in the sciences, 
        technology, and mathematics. Due to this, the idea of including writing education in 
        addition to this rigorous schedule seems trivial to many, since we’ve been learning to 
        write since elementary school. The issue with this argument is that writing is one of 
        the most valuable skills a STEM major can possess.

      <p>
        In Sharon L. Burns and Darwin R. Church’s <a href="http://aurco.net/Journals/AURCO_Journal_2013/Writing_Conceptual_AURCO_Vol19_2013.pdf">paper</a> 
        they write that “While many institutions incorporate a writing component into their 
        science curricula, few have a coordinated collaborative effort to fully integrate 
        composition and science disciplines.” At the University of Central 
        Florida, the latter statement is true. The university implemented a
         <a href="http://catalog.ucf.edu/policies/gep">general education program</a> 
        (GEP) in an effort to cover the core foundational skills necessary for higher 
        education. For writing, the classes ENC1101 and ENC1102 are meant to establish baseline 
        skills necessary for research and writing in the academic setting. These two 
        introductory writing courses are a requirement for all UCF students, and while they 
        establish the basics skills of academic writing, they rarely cover any of the major 
        writing skills a STEM student will face in their academic and professional career.

      <p>
        While your STEM education continues, your writing skills will go uncultivated, which leaves you with poor communication skills, something necessary for any job market. As chemist 
        Loretta Jackson Hayes
         <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/18/we-dont-need-more-stem-majors-we-need-more-stem-majors-with-liberal-arts-training/?utm_term=.851057d33c80">states</a> 
        , “A scientist trained in the liberal arts has another huge advantage: 
        writing ability. The study of writing and analyses of texts equip science students to 
        communicate their findings as professionals in the field”. This lack of education at the 
        university will severely impact these students post graduation, but which students are 
        going to face the most challenges?
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this research, we’ve separated the UCF STEM student population into    three categories:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro" id="one">
      <p> <strong style="font-size: 150%; color: #666;">1. </strong>For the students in the first category, their writing education will stop after ENC1101 
        and ENC1102. While they may continue to write in courses in their ensuing academic 
        careers, they are no longer required to take a writing centered course. These 
        students will find the most benefit from the results of our research, since
        utilizing
         <a href="./res_home.html">supplemental materials</a> 
        will be crucial to fill in this educational gap. The majority of STEM students will
        fall into this category, and for this reason the majority of this report will be
        directed at this group.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro" id="two">
      <p><strong style="font-size: 150%; color: #666;">2.</strong>The second category comprises students who are required to take ENC1101 and ENC1102, as 
        well as one to three additional writing courses. For example, computer science 
        majors are required to take ENC3241, which is a writing for the technical profession 
        course. Students in this category receive a more specialized form of writing 
        education as these additional courses are meant to teach specific skills relevant to 
        their discipline. It is important to note that while these students are receiving 
        more training than your average STEM student in writing, supplemental resources will 
        still be crucial to their success and growth as writers.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro" id="three">
      <p><strong style="font-size: 150%; color: #666;">3.</strong>The final category is students with adequate education. These STEM students are in    
        science majors with a heavy emphasis on writing, such as the Physics major on a 
        technical writing track. These students will have received ample writing training 
        and instruction by the end of their academic careers, and so they may already be 
        utilizing many of the resources we will be providing. It is worth noting, however, 
        that there is always room for improvement. For this reason, these students may still 
        find the use of some of these resources valuable.
