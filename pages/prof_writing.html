        Writing skills showcase potential job applicant’s abilities, and they also indicate a person’s work performance. People with stronger writing skills get paid more. Robert 
        Hosking in an  
         <a href="http://executivesecretary.com/why-good-writing-skills-are-important-in-todays-workplace-and-tips-for-developing-them/">article</a> 
        once “Good writing skills are a key asset at every stage of your career; from the moment 
        you write your very first cover letter and resume/CV until your retirement party.”
        In a 2013
         <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/press-room/research/docs/Good%20Grammar%20Will%20Get%20You%20Promoted_03.2013.pdf">study</a> 
        conducted by Grammarly, found that professionals with fewer grammar errors 
        achieved higher positions, more promotions, and fewer job changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On average people with fewer spelling mistakes had higher job earnings. It should be noted that there many factors in determining ones pay but generally better work performance 
        and in every work environment ones performance is what determines how much they are paid.
        In a 2014
         <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/strong-writing-skills-make-you-better-at-your-job-and-pay-more-infographic/">study</a> 
        Grammarly found that engineers, designers, and programmers made more spelling and 
        grammar mistakes than writes and translators. In a <a href="https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/writing-skills-on-job">journal article</a> 
        Katherine Hansen, while writing her book she noticed that not only was 
        writing important in the workplace but how too many workers, especially at the entry 
        level, lack these skills.
      </p>
      <p>In 2004 a College Board <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/writingcom/writing-ticket-to-work.pdf">study</a> 
        showed that the majority of U.S employers said that a third of workers fail to meet the 
        writing requirements of their positions. Like the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/strong-writing-skills-make-you-better-at-your-job-and-pay-more-infographic/">study</a> 
        done by Grammarly, there is a correlation between ones writing ability and getting a 
        promoted. They also found that American companies spend over $3.1 
        billion dollars just in private-sector employees of government or the retail and 
        wholesale trade sector, neither of which is represented among respondents. Out of the 
        firms that answered the survey over 40% said they require or offer writing training 
        and/or retraining.

        Employers are looking for and need people that can write effectively come off as professional and credible in their work. By now you can probably agree that writing in 
        the workplace is very important which is why we need students to become effective 
        writers before they graduate. Right now the job market outs a great emphasis on STEM but 
        we cannot forget about the importance of writing in today’s society. As Kaleigh Moore 
        states in her <a href="https://www.inc.com/kaleigh-moore/study-73-of-employers-want-candidates-with-this-skill.html">article</a> 
        business continues to move into increasingly tech-based communication (like email, 
        texting, etc.), hiring a team with strong writing skills is essential.
