        On campus organizations are great way for students to get involved with their school while also developing a professional network. STEM students can take
        advantage of over fifty clubs designed for astronomy, biology, computer 
        sciences, chemistry, and engineering. More information about UCF student organizations 
        can be found <a href="https://ucf.campuslabs.com/engage/">here</a>.

      <h2>Hack UCF (Collegiate Cyber Defense Club @ UCF)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are currently perusing a degree in information securityor just have an interest in the subject then Hack UCF is the place for you.
        Students participate in talks and workshops to learn and apply offensive and defensive
        security strategies. The benefit here is students will learn the techniques to write and
        effectively communicate these ideas.
        Students looking to improve their writing and communication skills can do so by 
        presenting
        their research or even publishing it on their website.
