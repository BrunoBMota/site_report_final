        One of the most efficient ways you can improve your writing skills is by taking a writing class. Courses provide you with a structured environment and professional 
        lecturer to teach you new skills and techniques that will undoubtedly help to 
        improve your writing. While these courses do cost money and are not a free resource, 
        they are a worthy investment since they will help to fill an educational gap you are 
        at risk of having when you graduate.
