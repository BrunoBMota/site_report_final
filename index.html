        Writing is a skill necessary in any professional and academic environment, and for this reason it should be a critical aspect of any studentâ€™s education. Unfortunately, for
        students in the <a href="#" id="stem_def">STEM</a> field, a rigorous course load often prevents them from being able to continue
        their writing education. This leaves them with an educational gap that will be 
        detrimental to their academic career, as well as their future professional careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have compiled a collection of supplementary resources STEM students at the University of Central Florida can utilize to help fill in this educational gap. Here you will be able 
        to find information on
         <a href="pages/stem_writing_courses.html">writing courses</a> aimed at improving your writing skills, <a href="pages/res_oncampus.html">on campus organizations</a> that will assist with your writing development and where to locate them, and 
        information on the <a href="pages/res_uwc.html">UCF Writing Center</a>, including where to find it and how to schedule an appointment. You will also find
        information as to why writing is critical to your <a href="pages/prof_writing.html">professional development</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using these supplemental resources, you will be able to improve your writing skills by learning profession specific skill sets. These new skills will not only assist you in 
        your future academic endeavors, but will also make you a better candidate for STEM 
        careers.
